Of Waste's Edge

Location

Waste's Edge is situated on the high plain of Belerinath at the headwaters of the Elenstroem.
The land south of the river rises gently towards a range of low hills, that stretches all the way
from Cirdanth in the west to the nearby mountains. Jagged cliffs on the hills far side form
the southern coast of the continent and prevent the landing of any ocean going vessel.
Not far to the east lie the Oreth-Arinyae, the Mountains of Dawn, home to many Dwarves.
Their closest settlement, Uzdun'kal, lies not far from the spring of the Elenstroem that makes
its way over numerous falls and rapids down to the plain of Belerinath.

On the remaining sides, Waste's Edge is surrounded by dense, primeval forest, dotted
with a few small villages inhabited by Half-Elves and Men. The nearest cities are Elgilad,
the High City of Elves to the north, and Cirdanth, the elven Haven at the western tip of the
mainland.

History

For many centuries, a limited amount of trade between Elves and Dwarfs has taken place
along the Elenstroem. The Elves desired precious ores and gems for their workings of magic
and in exchange the Dwarves received all kinds of food they could not grow in the harsh
mountain climate. Most of the actual travelling was done by Half-Elves, loyal and obedient
servants to the elven Lords and Ladies, who did not mind the long journey through uninhabited
wilderness, as is their nature.

With the arrival of Men, the situation changed. Their need for all kinds of ore as well as
for the renowned dwarvish armour and weapons was by far larger. Soon big caravans were
making their way through the wilderness, an easy prey for brigands and rivalling chieftains.
The voyage by boat up the Elenstroem proved to be safer, but near the Oreth-Arinyae rapids
made the river unnavigable. The boats had to stay behind, while the crews were carrying
the goods into the mountains. As the landing saw more and more traffic, crude docks were
erected, improved and rebuilt over the years.

Not long and it occurred to the merchants that boats moored on the plain of Belerinath,
waiting for the return of their crews were not earning any revenues. In a combined effort,
they had storehouses erected at the docks, so that both caravans from the mountains and
boats coming up the Elenstroem could pick up new freight without much delay.

Any place seeing that much traffic attracts more people, seeking for new opportunities,
and soon a smithy, two farms and the Redwyne Inn joined the small harbour. To provide
protection against bandits, the Inn was surrounded by a wall and a small fee collected from
every mooring ship pays for a number of guards.

Still, Waste's Edge lies too remote, and too far in elven territory, to grow into anything
different than the small trading post it has been for many generations.
