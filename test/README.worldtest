Adonthell - Dun Barethsol v0.4 aka Worldtest
============================================

Purpose
=======

Worldtest is a very, very simple test of the Adonthell engine's graphics, map, 
and input systems. It is designed to be useable with either a gamepad or the 
keyboard. The demo does not take mouse input. 

Please note that while the demo has been designed for gamepad input, this is
not enabled by default. See below for details.

Controls
========

Controls are configured in the main engine configuration file adonthell.xml.
The default settings are listed below. Please change to better suit your own 
preferences.

Game Controller Input:
======================

To configure game controller input, change the input configuration to
something like:

 <Input>
   <a_button>button 0</a_button>
   <b_button>button 1</b_button>
   <c_button>button 2</c_button>
   <d_button>button 3</d_button>
   <move_south>axis 0 back</move_south>
   <move_north>axis 0 fore</move_north>
   <move_west>axis 1 back</move_west>
   <move_east>axis 1 fore</move_east>
 </Input>

You may have to revert axis or juggle the buttons around a bit to get something
that matches your specific controller. In the future, there will be a simpler
in-game menu to configure input.
