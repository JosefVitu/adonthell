Also make sure to check the mailing list archive, in case your problem
has already been brought up before. 


Advanced configure options:
===========================

There are a number of options to 'configure' that might be useful
for you. For a complete list, run 'configure --help'.


--disable-nls

  Use this option to disable NLS completely. For more information
regarding this and the previous option, read the ABOUT-NLS file in
this directory.

  
--disable-xmltest
--disable-sdltest

  If configure claims to not find the SDL or XML library although 
they are there, or if you try to cross-compile, you can disable 
the respective test. 

Another way to workaround such a problem might be to recreate 
'configure' by running the 'autogen.sh' script.


--with-<x>-prefix=PFX

  This allows you to specify the path to various libraries. (replace
the <x> with the name of the library.) This is useful if you have 
installed those libraries in unusual locations, although it might be
better to set the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, or to add
those directories to /etc/ld.so.conf.


--with-data-dir=DIR

  Use this option to customise the location of the data directory.
The default is /usr/local/share/adonthell. Once you have compiled
Adonthell you can query the data directory with 'adonthell -d'.
