Installation:
=============

See the INSTALL file for details.

Note that this package alone doesn't allow you to play anything -
you'll need a game package in addition to this one. However, there
are a few sample scripts and programs in the test directory that
you can try. See test/README for further information.


Configuring Adonthell:
======================

The first time you run Adonthell, a configuration file is created:
adonthell.xml. Edit it to customise the game to your convenience.

The available options and their default values are:

* Audio

  To be done.

* General

  <Backend>sdl</Backend>
  Library to use for low level hardware access. For now, only 'sdl'
  is available.

* Input

  <move_east>right</move_east>
  <move_north>up</move_north>
  <move_south>down</move_south>
  <move_west>left</move_west>
  Movement controls; defaults to arrow keys.

  <a_button>left shift</a_button>
  Run while this key is pressed.

  <b_button>space</b_button>
  Jump.

  <c_button>left control</c_button>
  Unused

  <d_button>escape</d_button>
  Unused

* Video

  <Fullscreen>1</Fullscreen>
  Enable Fullscreen mode. Set to 0 to switch to Windowed mode.


Directories:
============

- $HOME/.adonthell
  contains the configuration file and your saved games.

- Global data directory
  You can get this directory by invoking 'adonthell -d' (by default
  /usr/local/share/adonthell). This is the directory where games will
  install to. If you have a game installed somewhere else, you can
  play it by invoking 'adonthell -g </full/path/to/my/game>'


Environment Variables:
======================

- ADONTHELL_MODULES_PATH
  directory to search for Adonthell backend modules. Overwrites the
  default path ($prefix/lib/adonthell).
