
                       Adonthell on Win32

This file  contains  additional information for compiling  Adonthell
under Windows for x86. For general compilation instructions refer to
the INSTALL file.


Setup Build Environment (MSys/MinGW):
=====================================

The instruction below assumes  that you are using the mingw compiler
on top of the msys shell, which will produce native windows binaries
that  don't  depend on  any posix  compatibility libraries,  such as
cygwin.dll.

We will further assume that all the packages below will be installed
to  /usr/local,  since it is  not recomended  to  pollute  msys with
'foreign' files.   If you'd rather  install things  into a different
directory  (e.g  /mingw),  make sure to replace  all  occurences  of
/usr/local with your chosen directory instead.

Also note that  many of  the issues with the packages below  and the
workarounds to get them compiling and installed might be specific to
the version used.   If you resort to using different versions,  your
mileage may vary,  although  it can be  expected that a  more recent
version will give better results.


1) Install MinGW/MSys (http://www.mingw.org/)

    * Download the following files from the MinGW website:
        - MinGW-5.0.3.exe
        - MSys-1.0.10.exe
        - msysDTK-1.0.1.exe

    * Follow the instructions here to install MinGW and MSys:
        http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki/index.php/SmartQuickStart

    * Create/Edit $HOME/.profile and add the following lines:
        export CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
        export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
        export CXXFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
        export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib

    * Run MSys and create the following symlink:
        $ ln -s /usr/bin/less.exe /usr/bin/more


Prepare to build Adonthell CVS version:
=======================================

If  you intend  to build  Adonthell from CVS,  there are a  few more
steps to follow,  as msys comes with fairly outdated versions of the
GNU autotools.


1) Install autoconf (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

    * Download autoconf 2.60 and compile/install in msys:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make
        $ make install


2) Install automake (http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)

    * Download automake 1.9.6 and compile/install in msys:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make
        $ make install


3) Install libtool (http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)

    * Download libtool 1.5.22 and compile/install in msys:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make
        $ make install


Enable National Language Support (NLS):
=======================================

If you don't mind  compiling a version  of Adonthell  that will only
support the English language, you can safely skip these steps.

Otherwise,  you'll have to install the following libraries and tools
before compiling Adonthell:


1) Install libiconv (http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/)

    * Download libiconv 1.11 and compile(install in msys:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make
        $ make install


2) Install GNU gettext (http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)

    * Download gettext 0.15 and compile/install in msys:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make
        $ make install


Install Adonthell prerequisites:
================================

The following  tools and libraries are required by Adonthell.   Make
sure to install them in the listed order,  as they might also depend
on each other.


1) Install Python for Windows (http://www.python.org)

    * Download python-2.4.3.msi and execute the installer.   Chose a
      installation directory without whitepace in the pathname,  e.g
      C:\Python2.4


2) Install Python for MingW
   (http://jove.prohosting.com/iwave/ipython/pyMinGW.html)

    * Download pyMinGW-bin-core-2.4.3.1.zip

    * Extract this over your Python installation to replace
      corresponding files.

    * Copy contents of the MinGW folder to the toplevel Python2.4
      folder to replace the executables and dll file

    * Create links to Python library and header files in msys:
        $ ln -s /c/Python2.4/python24.dll /usr/local/bin/python24.dll
        $ ln -s /c/Python2.4/libs/libpython24.a /usr/local/lib/libpython24.a
        $ ln -s /c/Python2.4/python.exe /usr/local/bin/python.exe
        $ ln -s /c/Python2.4/include /usr/local/include/python2.4

    * Note:  in order to start  Python  in interactive mode from the
      msys shell, you need to run 'start python'.


3) Install SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)

    * To compile with DirectX support, get the following file and
      extract into /usr/local
      http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/common/directx-devel.tar.gz

    * Get SDL-1.2.11.tar.gz, extract and compile/install by following
      these steps:

        $ make install


4) Install zlib (http://www.zlib.net/)

    * Download zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz, extract and compile by following
      these steps:
        $ make -f win32/Makefile.gcc
        $ make install -f win32/Makefile.gcc \
            INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include \
            LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
        $ cp zlib1.dll /usr/local/bin/


5) Install Freetype2 (http://www.freetype.org/)

    * Download freetype 2.2.1 source code, extract and compile by
      following the steps lined out below:
        $ ./configure LDFLAGS="'-no-undefined -L/usr/local/lib'" \
            --prefix=/usr/local
        $ mingw32-make
        $ make install


6) Install Libxml2 (http://xmlsoft.org/)

    * Download libxml-sources-2.6.26, extract and compile in msys by
      following the steps below:

        $ ./configure --without-python --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make
        $ make install

    * Note: the resulting DLL will be named cyglibxml2-2.dll. It does
      not depend on cygwin however.


7) Install OggVorbis (http://www.xiph.org/downloads/)

    * Download libogg 1.1.3, extract and compile within msys:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make
        $ make install

    * Download libvorbis 1.1.2, extract and compile within msys:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

        Edit lib/Makefile and replace line
            libvorbisfile_la_LIBADD = libvorbis.la
        with
            libvorbisfile_la_LIBADD = -logg libvorbis.la

        $ make
        $ make install


8) Install SDL_Mixer (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)

    * Get source code, extract and compile/install in msys:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make
        $ make install


9) Install libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)

    * Get source code, extract and compile/install in msys:
        $ ./configure

        Edit Makefile and change the line
            for ext in a la so; do\
        to
            for ext in a la; do\

        $ make
        $ make install


10) Install SWIG (http://www.swig.org/)

    * Download swig-1.3.29.tar.gz and compile/install
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make
        $ make install

    * Update $HOME/.profile with the following line,  otherwise SWIG
      will not be able to find its library files:
        export SWIG_LIB=/usr/local/share/swig/1.3.29


11) Install pkg-config
    (http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html)

    * Get pkg-config-0.20.zip and extract it into /usr/local.
      There is no way to compile pkg-config yourself, as it requires
      glib 2.0, which in turn requires pkg-config.  It's okay to use
      the binary version though :-).
      
    * Edit $HOME/.profile and add the following line:
		export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig


12) Install cmake (http://http://www.cmake.org)

	* Get cmake-2.4.3-win32-x86.zip and  put the 'bin', 'doc', 'man' 
	  and 'share' directories into /usr/local.

    * Edit $HOME/.profile and add the following lines:
        export CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include
        export CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib


Compiling Adonthell:
====================

After installing all the libraries and tools  above,  we are finally
ready to compile Adonthell. Inside the adonthell directory, do:

    $ mkdir ../adonthell-build && cd ../adonthell-build
    $ cmake -G "MSys Makefiles" ../adonthell

Note that this will put all compilation products  into a folder next
to your source code,  as to not clutter it  with intermediate object 
files,  DLLs and all the other junk created when building Adonthell.

From then on, you should be able to go to your Eclipse IDE and build
Adonthell from there  (see below),  or just type 'make' to start the
build from MSys.


Using Eclipse IDE for Adonthell development:
============================================

If you plan to do  programming work  on Adonthell  and want to use a
modern IDE,  Eclipse is a good choice as it works transparently with
the toolchain we set up in preparation to compile Adonthell.

To use Eclipse to develop C/C++, download and install the following:

    * Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers
      http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Then follow the tutorial at [1]  to import the Adonthell source code
as a Standard Make C++ Project. 

You should also create a second project that points to your seperate
build directory,  as you will have to run make inside there, instead
of inside the source directory.  Just make sure to go to the 'build'
project Properties / Project References  where you should select the
'source' project as a dependency.

Before you can finally run 'make' from within Eclipse, you will have
to add C:\msys\1.0\bin (or wherever you  have installed MSys) to the 
Windows system path, so that make.exe can be found.
